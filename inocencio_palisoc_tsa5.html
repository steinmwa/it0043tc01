            <p class="desc">Sadness is the deuteragonist of the Disney/Pixar film Inside Out. She is one of the five emotions inside the mind of Riley Andersen.Sadness first appears at Riley's birth. She appears 33 seconds after Riley's first emotion, Joy, is born. Sadness makes Riley bawl, but Joy pushes Sadness out of the way and makes Riley happy. Due to Joy's obsession with keeping Riley happy, she unintentionally mistreats Sadness. As a matter of fact, the other emotions tend to exclude Sadness as well. They won't let Sadness take the wheel at all, no matter how sad the situation needs to be. When Riley moves to San Francisco, everything starts to go bad; Riley's dad doesn't have time for her, Riley hates the house, they only serve broccoli pizza and the moving van won't come for weeks. Sadness thinks this is a good time for her to handle Riley's problems, but Joy won't let her.</p>

            <p class="desc">Joy is the main protagonist of the Disney/Pixar film Inside Out. She is one of the original five emotions inside the mind of Riley Andersen. Joy's goal has always been to make sure Riley stays happy. She is lighthearted, optimistic and determined to find the fun in every situation. Joy sees challenges in Riley's life as opportunities, and the less happy moments as hiccups on the way back to something great. As long as Riley is happy, so is Joy. Joy appears in the film as one of the five emotions in Riley Andersen's mind, which she is the leader of the group. When Riley was first born, Joy was the first ever emotion to be born.  </p>

                <p class="desc">Anger is one of the many emotions controlling Riley Andersen's mind. He lives in her brain and works with the other emotions. When the leader, Joy and another emotion, Sadness, get lost in Riley's mind, he and the others have to keep Riley's head on straight until they get home. Next to Joy, he may be the most abrasive to Sadness. Anger is introduced when Mr. Andersen tells a young Riley she can't have dessert if she doesn't eat her broccoli. He is enraged but calms down when Riley's dad says the broccoli is an airplane. When Riley and her family move to San Francisco, Anger, along with the other emotions, is disappointed when he sees their new home and creates some negative memories. He lightens up when Joy starts coming up with ideas on how to decorate the place, but is infuriated when they find out the moving van with all of their belongings hasn't arrived yet.</p>
